#VootDownloder

The **voot-downloader** is an project by which the user can download particular shows all the episode in just 2 click . I have made this project using
angular and express js.


# Folder Structure

There are 2 folder which you will find in the repositories which is **front-end** and  **back-end**. As the name itself say that the **front-end** folder belong to **Angular Code** and **back-end** folder belong to **express.js code** there is no data store in any database and hence there **No data layer** (no database)

# Limitation

 - [ ] **The user are not able to download the voot select/premium show/episode**
