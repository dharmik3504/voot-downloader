The **voot-downloader** is an project by which the user can download particular shows all the episode in just 2 click . I have made this project using
angular and express js.


# Usage

After downloading the project open the **front-end folder in [visual studio code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** and open the terminal and type 

> **npm install**

 to install the all the packages. After installing the packages run the front-end code with 

> **ng-serve**

The project will be loaded in this  [Address](http://localhost:4200/)

# Key Features
You can specify the range of episode  you want to download like
if the total number of episode is 25 then

       Enter the Range of Episode : 1-5,7-10,15-*

The following pattern will ensure that it will download only from this range of episode here  (* asterisk) means all the episode from that show 

# Note:

 1. > **Make sure [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  and [Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) is install in your system**
 
 2. >**Make sure that the back-end and front-end  code is running without any error simultaneously.**

# Limitation

 - [ ] **The user are not able to download the voot select/premium show/episode**
 
# Credits
I'd like to thank Voot for their amazing content, and I didn't create this in the idea of piracy, but instead, wanted to showcase how easy it is to download a video from the website.
